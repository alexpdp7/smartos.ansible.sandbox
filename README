SmartOS modules are in the devel branch for Ansible 2.3, so you cannot use
packaged/pip versions.

Create a virtualenv with Python 3 and:

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

You might need to pip install appdirs separately prior to that.

Install Python on SmartOS so it can be managed by Ansible:

$ ansible-playbook -i hosts bootstrap_ansible.yml

Create a CentOS 7 LX Zone:

$ ansible-playbook create_centos.yml

(you can use vmadm list to find out the uuid, zlogin <uuid> to enter the
zone and find out its IP, then you can:

$ ssh -i private.key root@<ip>

to ssh to the box with this repo's sample keys)
